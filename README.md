# react-template

## About

A project for all the basics you'll need to start a react project.

It doesn't come with the fancy stuff like webpack-dev-server or popular libraries like redux as those kinds of things aren't always necessary.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`

Build your project in dev mode with `yarn watch` or production with `yarn build`.
