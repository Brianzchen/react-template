# react-template

## About

This project is intended to be a quick start pack if I ever want to jump into creating something new and don't want to set it up every time. It has all the basics you need to get started.

This more or less replicates what `create-react-app` does but my preference is to build the setup myself.

Redux is not included with this package, because although it's a great library, it's not necessary for all projects

## Getting started

Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`

Start the web-server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
And run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a build for distribution
